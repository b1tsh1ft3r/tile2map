# tile2map
Tile map converter for the Sega saturn. Converts between Csv export from Tiled Map editor to a custom Sega saturn map format that can be easily read at run time by the system.

The tool assumes that the cell value on the tilemap has a complimenting image file name called that value for the saturn.

Example

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1.TGA or 0.TGA would be files that would need to exist for saturn jo-engine as it will convert the tile map to a formated
listed of images with x/y coordinates for jo-engine to process.
